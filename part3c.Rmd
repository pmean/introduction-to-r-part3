# Part 3c. boxplots

Erase any stray data and load the data from part 3b.

```{r read-part-3b-data}
rm(list=ls())
load(file="part3b.RData")
```

When you want to look at a relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable, you should use a boxplot.

```{r pu.boxplots-fev}
boxplot(fev~smoke.factor,data=pu)
```

This is very odd. You can get a hint as to why smokers might have higher fev values than non-smokers by looking at how age and smoking status are related.

```{r pu.boxplots-age}
boxplot(age~smoke.factor,data=pu)
```


## On your own

Look at the relationship between sex and fev.

## Save all my work

```{r save-image}
save.image("part3c.RData")
```
